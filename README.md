# MyTextEditor

Project Note: This is a Lab exercise at FPT University. In this project, it has some bugs in the font changer function and was quickly fixed by me, but not yet optimized. However, the functions still perform according to the requirements of the topic (verified by instructor HaiLT-Le Thanh Hai ). So this project is still a useful reference for those who want to do this Lab exercise.
